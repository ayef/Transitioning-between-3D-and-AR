TRANSITIONING BETWEEN 3D AND AR IN WAYFINDING SYSTEMS

-----------------------------------------------------------

3D-maps and Augmented Reality systems can be used for example when visiting a cultural attraction or location and using a mobile device to navigate at the venue. The Augmented reality interface can be used to get contextual information on various objects at the location, while the 3D maps can be used for simple map navigation. The aim is to improve user experience by allowing switching between 3D and Augmented Reality (AR) views of the application. The type of interactions the user needs to employ to switch views within such a system must be seamlessly integrated into the system in such a way that the user feels the application is natural, intuitive, and effortless to use. The user interface and design of such an application is critical to the user experience; it will determine whether the user finds the system burdensome and a pain to use, or facilitative and easy to employ.

The purpose of this project is to study which are the most suitable interaction techniques for the system, mainly those concerning transitioning between 3D and AR views. These techniques include finger gestures and traditional GUI techniques like button-press. Several interaction techniques have been implemented and tested and two user studies have been performed with a paper and software prototype respectively. The paper prototype was used to determine the interaction techniques favoured by users out of a larger selection of possible interactions. The most preferred interactions were then implemented in the software prototype and users’ opinions were collected a second time.
